This project is an interactive Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) simulator implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to visualize the execution of processes across multiple queues with different scheduling algorithms, providing detailed insights into scheduling behaviors. This project was developed in collaboration by **Vaibhav Gupta** and **Rupesh Bhusare**.

## Features

- **Process Management**:
  - Add processes dynamically with attributes: *Arrival Time*, *CPU Burst*, and *Priority*.
- **Queue Configuration**:
  - Simulates **4 distinct queues**, each utilizing different scheduling algorithms:
    Round Robin (RR)
    Shortest Job First (SJF)
    Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
    First Come, First Serve (FCFS)
- **Visualization**:
  - Displays the **Gantt Chart** in a textual timeline format, highlighting the process execution sequence.
  - Displays the **Queue Intervals**  in a textual timeline format.
  - Displays the **Queue Visualisation Table **  in a tabular form.

## For instruction
  - **Refer to the PPT file.**
